The ⌘-k "access anything" shortcut is awesome on Notion, Slack, etc.

The terminal, by comparison, is a dinosaur: tons of repeated `cd` and `ls` and `TAB` just to get anywhere.

This is ⌘-k for the terminal: access anything on your filesystem, from anywhere, with previews before you open:

When you press enter, the type of selected files are identified and...

- Directories get `cd`d to
- Text files get opened in the command of your [`$EDITOR` variable](https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/$EDITOR_variable) (or `vim -O` if it's unset)
- Images and PDFs get opened in the Preview app
- `.key` files get opened in Keynote

_I'm extremely grateful to [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf); this project wouldn't be possible without it. I'd been fed up with terminal navigation for a decade, and fzf was the missing piece needed to make cmdk possible._

Installation
------------
1. Install `cmdk` and dependencies:
   ```sh
   # NOTE: 'bat', 'tiv', and 'poppler' are optional: for previewing text, image, and PDF files respectively
   brew install fzf fd bat tiv poppler
   ```
2. ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mieubrisse/cmdk.git ~/.cmdk
   ```
3. Add to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`:
   ```sh
   source ~/.cmdk/cmdk.sh   # Provides a 'cmdk' function in your shell
   ```
   Or if you're on `fish`, to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:
   ```sh
   source ~/.cmdk/cmdk.fish
   ```
4. (Optional) Bind the `⌘-k` hotkey (or any other if you prefer) to send the text `cmdk\n` in your terminal:
   <details>
   <summary>💻 iTerm</summary>
   
   `Settings → Profiles → Keys → Keybindings → + → Send Text`, then binding `⌘-k` to send the text `cmdk\n`
   
   </details>
   <details>
   <summary>👻 Ghostty</summary>
   
   ```
   # ~/.config/ghostty/config  (or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ghostty/config)
   keybind = cmd+k=text:cmdk\r
   ```
   
   </details>
5. Open a new shell and press your hotkey (⌘-K if you bound it) or enter `cmdk` (if you don't have a hotkey)
6. (Optional) If you'd like to use `cmdk`'s functionality with `fzf`'s <Ctrl-T>, add the following to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:
   ```
   export FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND="bash ${HOME}/.cmdk/list-files.sh"
   export FZF_CTRL_T_OPTS="-m --ansi --scheme=path --preview='bash ${HOME}/.cmdk/preview.sh {}'"
   ```
   TODO `fish` 

Usage
-----
Press ⌘-k (or type `cmdk`) and...

- Type to start filtering
  > 💡 If you're trying to get a directory, add a `/` to the end of your search term. E.g. `down/` will pull up the `Downloads` directory
- `Ctrl-j` and `Ctrl-k` to scroll up and down the results list
- `ENTER` to select the result
- `TAB` to select multiple items before `ENTER`
- `Ctrl-u` to clear the selection

> ⚠️ Some directories like `Library`, `/`, and `.git` are full of stuff users don't need to access, so their contents are excluded. To get to their contents, first ⌘-k to them and then ⌘-k again to see their contents.

> 💡 Sometimes you only want to jump to the contents of the current directory. This can be done by calling `cmdk -o` to list **o**nly the contents of the current directory (no recursing) or `cmdk -s` to list **s**ubdirectories (recursing). I've set up separate iTerm hotkeys: `⌘-k` to send `cmdk\n`, and `⌘-shift-k` for `cmdk -s\n`.

### Command-line Flags

- `-o` - Only list the contents of the current directory at depth 1 (original behavior)
- `-s` - List all contents of the current directory recursively, including subdirectories

### Editor Configuration

By default, cmdk opens text files using your `$EDITOR` environment variable, or falls back to `vim -O` if unset. You can configure any editor:

**Neovim:**
```bash
export EDITOR=nvim
```

**Cursor:**
```bash
export EDITOR=cursor
```

**VS Code:**
```bash
export EDITOR="code -w"
```

**Neovim with vertical splits for multiple files:**
```bash
export EDITOR="nvim -O"
```

**For Fish shell users**, add to `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:
```fish
set -gx EDITOR nvim
```

**For Bash/Zsh users**, add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
export EDITOR=nvim
```

Feedback
--------
Hi HN! I'd love to hear how you're using cmdk, and making it your own.
