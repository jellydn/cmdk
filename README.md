The ‚åò-k "access anything" shortcut is awesome on Notion, Slack, etc.

The terminal feels like a dinosaur in comparison: tons of repeated `cd` and `ls` and `TAB` just to get anything done.

This is ‚åò-k for the terminal: access anything on your filesystem, from anywhere, with previews before you open:

![](./demo2.png)

Based on what you choose...

- Directories get `cd`d to
- Text files get opened in `vim`
- Images and PDFs get opened in the Preview app
- `.key` files get opened in Keynote

_**Huge** thanks to [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf). I've been fed up with terminal navigation for a decade, and discovering fzf was the last piece needed to make this project possible._

Installation
------------
1. ```sh
   brew install fzf fd bat tiv
   ```
2. ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:mieubrisse/cmdk.git ~/.cmdk
   ```
3. Add to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`:
   ```sh
   source ~/.cmdk/cmdk.sh
   ```
4. Bind the `‚åò-k` hotkey to send the text `cmdk\n` in your terminal
   > üí° In iTerm, this is done with `Settings ‚Üí Profiles ‚Üí Keys ‚Üí Keybindings ‚Üí + ‚Üí Send Text`, then binding `‚åò-k` to send the text `cmdk\n`
5. Open a new shell

Usage
-----
Press ‚åò-k (or type `cmdk`) and...

- Type to start filtering
  > üí° If you're trying to get a directory, add a `/` to the end of your search term. E.g. `down/` will pull up the `Downloads` directory
- `Ctrl-j` and `Ctrl-k` to scroll up and down the results list
- `ENTER` to select the result
- `TAB` to select multiple items before `ENTER`
- `Ctrl-u` to clear the selection

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Some directories like `Library`, `/`, and `.git` are full of stuff users don't need to access, so their contents are excluded. To get to their contents, first ‚åò-k to them and then ‚åò-k again to see their contents.

TODO
----
- [Allow customizing the program used to open files](https://github.com/mieubrisse/cmdk/issues/4)
- [Allow for favoriting files that pop to the top of the search](https://github.com/mieubrisse/cmdk/issues/5)
- [Store the results of a selection in the history](https://github.com/mieubrisse/cmdk/issues/1)
